Let $\lambda_0 = 1, n = 20,$ and $\alpha = .05$. Simulate $X_1, \ldots , X_n \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_0)$ and perform the Wald test. Repeat many times and count often you reject the null. How close is the type I error rate to .05?

```{r}
set.seed(127)

# given information
lambda_0 <- 1
n <- 20
alpha <- 0.05

# repeat M times and track how many times we reject the null
M <- 1000
count_reject_null <- 0

# z_alpha/2
z <- qnorm(1-alpha/2)

for (i in 1:M) {
  simulation <- rpois(n,lambda_0)
  wald_statistic <- (mean(simulation) - lambda_0)/(sqrt(lambda_0/n))
  if (abs(wald_statistic) > z) {
    count_reject_null = count_reject_null + 1
  }
}
z
count_reject_null
```

In this simulation, we rejected the null 49 times out of 1000, which is remarkably close to a Type I error rate of .05.
