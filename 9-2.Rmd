Let $X_1, \ldots , X_n \sim \text{Uniform}(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are unknown parameters and $a < b$. Let $\tau = \int x dF(x)$.

Let $\widehat{\tau}$ be the MLE of $\tau$. Let $\widetilde{\tau}$ be the nonparametric plug-in estimator of $\tau = \int xdF(x)$. Suppose that $a = 1, b = 3, n = 10$. Find the MSE of $\widehat{\tau}$ by simulation. Compare this with the analytical derivation of the MSE of $\widetilde{\tau}$.

We want to find the MSE of $\widehat{\tau}$ by simulation. We have $MSE = \mathbb{E}[(\widehat{\tau} - \tau)^2]$, and we have that $\tau = 2.$

```{r}
set.seed(127)
N <- 10000
n <- 10
squaredDifferences <- c() # to store the (estimate - true)^2s

for (i in 1:N) {
  Xis <- runif(10,1,3) # generate the Xis
  tau_hat <- (min(Xis) + max(Xis))/2 # computed in the third part of the problem
  squaredDifferences[i] <- (tau_hat - 2)^2 
}

mean(squaredDifferences)
```

The analytical derivation of the MSE for $\tilde{\tau}$ yielded $\frac{1}{30}$, which is somewhat greater than this simulated MSE for $\widehat{\tau}$.
